        "description": "Inspired by the Milan Runway, two new shades to line and fill-in lips. Features:True instant colour in one stroke applicationLong wearing, easy-glide formulaNo dragSharpens with Milani’s Duo SharpenerNon-feathering formulaApplication: To outline your lips, make an X on the center of your upper lip (lip cleavage). Following the contour of your mouth, start from the outer edges of your lips and work your way towards center of your upper lip (where the x is marked). This will prevent from making one arch higher, pointier or rounder than the other.  Tip: Lipliner helps extend the wear & keeps your lipstick from feathering.   When choosing a lipliner shade, match the lipliner to your lipstick shade or match your lipliner to the shade of your lips which will work with all your lipstick shades.   Create a custom lipcolor by using a contrasting lipliner and lipstick shade.   Before applying your lipliner, pat your lips lightly with your foundation or pressed powder puff, which also helps keep you lipstick from feathering.

The all-new paddle-shaped tip gives\n you two looks in one—thick and dramatic or thin and elegant. The \nintense black formula glides on smoothly and dries quickly for instant \ndrama. Clinically tested, suitable for sensitive eyes.Directions: Stand 6 inches away from a mirror and tilt your chin up, so \nthat when you look down your nose into the mirror, you can see your \nentire eyelid. Dab concealer or dust translucent powder on your upper \nlids. Blend well with a sponge or lightly pat with a fingertip to cover \nveins and prevent creasing.Before applying liner, \ndetermine your eye shape. If eyes are close-set or round, line only the \nouter corners. Otherwise, line the entire upper lid.Gently pull your eyelid taut at an upward angle. Beginning at the inner \ncorner, draw small, connected dashes along the top lashes. Be sure to \nstay close to the roots so there is no skin visible between the lashes \nand the liner. To make eyes look bigger, extend the liner slightly \nbeyond the outer corners.Use a cotton swab to fix mistakes. For larger messes, dip it in makeup remover.",

        "description": "Misa's original nail lacquer formula was developed to meet the product requirements of demanding nail technicians. Each lacquer is properly balanced with resin, plasticizer and nitrocellulose to provide a durable film that offers high gloss, exceptional wear and maximum protection for the nail.The lacquers provide durability for the ultimate in chip-free results, with each lacquer offering a carefully balanced blend of film formers that are not adversely affected when exposed to water or detergents. The formula is nonfading with lasting color fidelity over time, as the use of UV absorbers helps maintain the true colors. The lacquers maintain an excellent shelf life, with a formula that prevents pigment migration, striation, settling and syneresis over longer periods of time than most other nail enamel formulas. And, as we guarantee, the chip-resistant polishes promise superior wear and exceptional gloss retention, while helping to condition, protect, strengthen and reinforce the natural nail.",
